# Dental Clinic — Appointments Manager

This is a small demo single-page app to manage dental appointments. It stores data in the browser `localStorage` so no external database or account is required.

Local development

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Deploying for free

- Vercel: connect this repository to Vercel (free) and deploy — Vercel will detect the Vite app automatically.
- Netlify: you can drag-and-drop the `dist` folder from `npm run build` into Netlify Drop or connect a Git repository.

If you want, I can:

- push this project to a GitHub repo and deploy to Vercel/Netlify for you (I will need access or you can invite me), or
- modify the app to use a cloud-hosted free database (Supabase/Railway) for persistent server-side storage.
